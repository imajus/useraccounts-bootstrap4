# What is this?

Meteor sign up and sign in templates (and much more!) styled for twitter Bootstrap 4

This package depends on [useraccounts:core](https://atmospherejs.com/useraccounts/core)

Learn more [here](https://github.com/meteor-compat/useraccounts-core/?tab=readme-ov-file) or have a look at the full [documentation](https://github.com/meteor-useraccounts/core/blob/master/Guide.md).


## Setting up

Adding this package with `meteor add imajus:useraccounts-bootstrap4` does not add any other packages providing Bootstrap. This is to let you choose the flavour you prefer, being it compiled, less, sass, or from CDN!

At the moment it is up to date with Bootstrap 4.6.x
